# Implementation-of-a-Bidirectional-Data-Transmission-System-with-Flow-Control-and-Noisy-Channel

The purpose of this project was the implementation of a one - way data transmission system with noisy channel. The transmitter and the receiver of the system as well as the communication protocol were implemented on Xilinx Arty boards in C language and the Xilinx SDK 2016.4 software was used for this purpose. The reception and transmission were performed through UART. Also, between the two Arty boards a noisy channel, implemented in Matlab, was inserted.
